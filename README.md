This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project meant to (playfully and not particularly faithfully) simulate the functionality of Unix-style terminal as a personal portfolio site.

The site is live at [Matt Stucky.dev](https://mattstucky.dev).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
